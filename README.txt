These are Java games I made in high school back when I first learned about Java and spent time learning about GUI and OOP.
I've since gotten significantly better at software design so take the redundant lines of code lightly :)

To execute the games, just download the jar and supporting image files. Of course, make sure you have Java installed.

Thank you Mr. Bolting for the fun times.
